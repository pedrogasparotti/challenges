# Predicting Car Prices with Machine Learning

This repository contains code to predict car prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for training and testing the model is stored in the 'cars_train.csv' file. Before running the code, make sure you have Python installed, along with the required libraries mentioned in the 'requirements.txt' file. To set up the environment, you can use a virtual environment:

Download (or clone) the repository to your local machine:
bash

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/car_price_prediction.git
cd car_price_prediction
```

Create a virtual environment and activate it (optional):

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, you can run the car price prediction code. In your local machine, open your favorite jupyter environment and run the main.ipynb file. The 'cars_test_predictions.csv' will be generated in your local machine.

Remember to install the requirements.

## Limitations

It is important to note that the car price prediction model may have limitations when making predictions on extremely high or low car prices. The presence of outliers in the dataset can significantly affect the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data. Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the majority of the data and can lead to biased predictions.

In this implementation, we have included a step to handle outliers by using the Z-score method. Data points with a Z-score greater than a certain threshold are considered outliers and are removed from the dataset before training the model. However, it is important to acknowledge that this approach may not completely eliminate all potential outliers.

To get more accurate predictions on extremely high or low car prices, it is recommended to have a more diverse and balanced dataset that includes a representative number of cars with extreme price values. Additionally, advanced outlier detection and handling techniques, such as robust statistical methods or specialized machine learning algorithms, can be explored to improve the model's performance.

Remember that the performance of any machine learning model depends on the quality and representativeness of the data used for training. Therefore, ensuring a clean and well-prepared dataset is crucial for obtaining reliable predictions.
